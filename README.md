# Operation System - Final Project

## Overview
This project includes a JavaScript file, main.js, which contains functions for calculating Fibonacci numbers, performing file operations, and executing intensive computations.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from Node.js official website.

## Installation
If the project is hosted on a repository (e.g., GitHub), clone it using:
bash
Alternatively, download the main.js file directly to your local machine.

If downloaded, navigate to the directory where main.js is located.

Open the Terminal: Ensure you are in the directory containing main.js.
Execute the Script:

`node main.js`

The script will execute the functions defined in main.js.

It will print the results of the Fibonacci calculation, file operations, and intensive computations in the console.

## Customization
To modify the Fibonacci number calculation or the number of iterations for file operations, open main.js in a text editor.
Adjust the values of numberFibonacci and iterationsFile as per your requirement.
Save the changes and rerun the script as mentioned above.

## Note:
This project is designed for educational and benchmarking purposes. It demonstrates various aspects of JavaScript programming such as recursion, file I/O, and performance-intensive computations. Specifically, this project can be used to compare how a virtual machine performs in contrast to an image in a Docker container, offering insights into efficiency and resource utilization in different virtualized environments. Remember, it is not intended for production use.
